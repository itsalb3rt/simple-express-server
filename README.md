## Simple express server for run statics sites

It is a personal project to test all my personal and work frontend projects, it is my day to day.

Before uploading anything to production I like to test the final product.

```bash
$ npm install
```

Put your site in `build` dir

Start server

```bash
$ npm run server
```

**Settings**

The `.env` file only have 1 var, `PORT` use this for specific the port.
